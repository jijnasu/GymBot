## About Project

### Statement
For a Retailer company, knowing its Customers Loyalty is very important. The company must know when its customers are losing interest from them, so that they can get their presence back. The same thing we can incorporate in the small businesses and small retailers which usually lack in this tech support and advancement. Which will help them to scale up faster.. 

### Abstract
So, to solve the problem we will find the CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) for the businesses looking at its previous data and check if it is a high risk of losing the customer. And we will integrate this to an android app for making it more user friendly .

**Tech stack**:

APP: Android Studio, Postman, XML, Java

=> even small retailers can use this user friendly app to increase their income and productivity.
=> small businesses lack tech aspects which this app will provide.
